        <p>Satoru Gojo (Japanese: 五条 悟, Hepburn: Gojō Satoru) is a fictional character from Gege Akutami's manga Jujutsu Kaisen. He was first introduced in Akutami's short series Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School as the mentor of JuJutsu High training the cursed teenager Yuta Okkotsu while dealing with his friends. This miniseries became the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 of Jujutsu Kaisen. In Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo takes the same role but this time he mentors the student Yuji Itadori who suffers a similar curse and wants him to help him be stronger while protecting other characters from the series.</p>
